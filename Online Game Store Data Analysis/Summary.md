# Summary

During our analysis, 
* we discovered that there are some missing values in our dataset which are left as unknown and to be determined. 
* We are provided with data for that ratings and sales of games in different regions. 
* We decided to to add the sales of these regions to get global sales which will play a big part in our analysis.

According to our dataset, we discovered that... 
* more games were released during the period of `2000` to `2009`, and very few were released during the 80s. 
* four platforms `(TG16, 3DO, GG, and PCFX)` made less than a million dollar sales globally and only six platforms made over 600 millions dollar sales globally `(PS2, X360, PS3, Wii, D5, PS)`, and the rest made less than 400 millions dollar sales. 
* the platform with the highest sales globally was `PS2`, making over 1200 millions dollar sales.
* generally, it took the old platforms like `PS` and `PS2` 10 years to fade away and it took a year for new platforms to appear.

Continuing with the analysis,
* we decided to pick `2013` as the year to take data from so that we will be able to build a prognosis for the year 2017, considering 3 years sufficient to study and make prediction for sales. 
* we started working with data from this year by ignoring the previous years.

We discovered that...
* the top five platforms that are leading in sales from 2013 to 2015 are `PS4, PS3, XOne, 3DS and X360`, with `PS4` having the highest sales globally of over 300 million dollars. 
* `Grand Theft Auto V` is the game with highest sales globally with 21.05 million dollars sales. We discovered that the differences in sales varies from platform to platform, meaning the differences is significant.

We considered `PS4` to be the most popular platform because it has the highest average sales of all platforms from 2013 till 2016. 

We discovered that...
* professional reviews did have impact on the sales on `PS4` and other platforms, but user reviews did not have impact on the sales on `PS4` and other platforms.
* `Action` genre sells more than all other genres in the `PS4` platform with the total sales of 963.44 million dollars from 2013 till 2016. This is followed by Shooter with a total sales of 611.46 million dollars. The least is `Puzzle` with a total sales of 56.30 million dollars.

Putting Northern America, Europe and Japan into consideration, we discovered that 
* the same set of five platforms are sharing the spots for the top 5 platforms in different region with `PS4` being on the top spot (number 1 position) in each region. 
* `3DS` also maintained the fifth position in each, but `PS3, XOne and X360` are swtching the second, third and forth positions.
* three genres `(Action, Shooter, and Role-Playing)` are common in the top 5 rankings for genre of games in each region.
* `Action` genre topped the list in North America and Europe, while Role-Playing topped in Japan.
* games with `M` (mature) rating has the highest sales in Nort America and Europe, with over 160 million dollars sales and 140 million dollars sales respectively. 
* games without the `esrb` rating have the highest sales of games in Japan with over 80 million dollars sales.

After carrying out hypothesis test to determine...
* if the average users ratings of the `Xbox One and PC` platforms are the same, we we could not reject our null hypothesis meaning that the user ratings of `Xbox One` platform are the same with the user ratings of `PC` platform, that is, the user ratings for the two platforms do not differ. This means that users enjoy playing games on one platform same as they enjoy playing on the other platform.
* if the average users ratings for the `Action and Sports` genres differs, we rejected our null hypothesis which suggested that the user ratings from `Action and Sports` genres differs, meaning users enjoy playing one genre than the other.

The global aim of this project is the **PREDICTION** of the sales, popularity, profitability of the platforms, so we need to analyze not past but now and future as it is mentioned in the instruction:

From our analysis, we can conclude that...
* there will be increase in sales of new platforms like PS4 and XOne as they are yet to be at their peak globally.
* for `North America` and `Europe` market, `Action and Shooting` games with M rating irrespective of the platform will see increase in sales in 2017. 
* also, games with high critic score of 70 and above will be profitable.
For the Japan market, Role-playing games without esrb rating will be more profitable.
